Project Description:

1.  Choose some points system for food
2.  Eat less than some healthy number of points per day

That's what we do.  Currently, I'm making the menus by hand.  Eventually I thought I would try a little automation, so here's an idea based on that.

Let's start stupid simple:

* Give me a way to enter food items:  name, plate_position (center or side only), and points
* Then, let me select from my food database one center item and one or more sides for each day of the coming week
* It shows me the final menu with point counts
