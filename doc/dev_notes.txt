Questions for James.

How do the Active Record Base objects in lib get called with their validations?

To install your gem file the command is.

  $ bundle install

Database Notes -

Database creation happens with the first migration when using SQLite.  If using PostgreSQL must run the createdb command first.

rake db:create_migration NAME="file_name" <- Creates the skeleton of the
                                             migration file in
                                             db/migrate
                                             (NOTE Spacing after NAME)
                                            
TODO - 

Refactor the final menu page to get some of the logic out of the page and back into lib.

Change the menu selection page to have drop down selection rather then the radio buttons.

Add a TBD menu item if you don't know what you want for dinner that evening.  Make this the
default setting so that the validation won't fail on empty.

Create access to other weeks (maybe pagination works here).

On load of the create menu page fill the selections in with choices that are already in the
database.
